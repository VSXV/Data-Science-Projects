# Project Description

Comparison between Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For instance:
* Moscow - a metropolis subject to the strict rhythm of the workweek.
* St. Petersburg - a cultural capital with its own tastes.

In this music application, we are comparing the behavior of users from both cities.

**Research Objective** - We will test three hypotheses:
1. User activity depends on the day of the week, and it manifests differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
2. On Monday mornings, different music genres prevail in Moscow compared to St. Petersburg. The same applies to Friday evenings, where different genres dominate depending on the city.
3. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different music genres. Pop music is more common in Moscow, while Russian rap is more popular in St. Petersburg.

**Research Process**

Nothing is known about the data quality. Therefore, before testing the hypotheses, we need to conduct a data overview.

You will check the data for errors and assess their impact on the study. Subsequently, during the data preprocessing stage, you will look for ways to rectify the most critical data errors.

The study will proceed through three stages:
1. Data overview.
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Hypothesis testing.
